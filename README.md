## Introduction

Welcome to the Sample React App, a project developed by [Mohamed Esmat] as a part of [UpSkilling] "Job Simulation Bootcamp" program. This app serves as a practical demonstration of your skills as a frontend developer, showcasing various features and best practices in React application development.

## Features

- React-based Single Page Application (SPA)
- Utilizes `react-router-dom` for routing
- Integrates `react-query` for data fetching and caching
- Implements loaders for improved user experience during data fetching
- Comprehensive error handling
- Smooth pagination of data
- Robust form validation
- Utilizes Axios for making HTTP requests
- Clean code and well-thought-out architecture
- Upcoming lazy loading for improved performance (to be implemented)
- Demonstrates best practices for React performance optimization (to be implemented)

## Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
- [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager installed

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Mohamed-Esmat/contacts-app-upskilling.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd contacts-app-upskilling
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```shell
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured organization to maintain code readability and scalability. Here's an overview of the main directories and files:

- `src/`: Contains the source code of your React application.
  - `components/`: React components.
  - `pages/`: Top-level pages/routes.
  - `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers.
- `public/`: Public assets and HTML template.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Usage

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Start the development server:

```shell
npm run dev
# or
yarn run dev
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

## Performance

In future updates, we plan to implement the following strategies to enhance the app's performance:

- **Lazy Loading**: We will implement lazy loading to load components and assets on-demand, reducing initial load times.
- **React Performance Optimization**: We will apply various performance optimization techniques such as memoization, reducing unnecessary re-renders, and optimizing component lifecycles.
